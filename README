Demo OPA WASM Browser Build
======================

To test the bundle.js build run a local webserver:

    % python3 -m http.server 9000

Then open the browser to http://localhost:9000/ and open the console. You
should see an array containing an {result: ["hello world"]}.

To manually generate the bundle you'll need node, npm & esbuild installed.

To install the dependencies run:

    % npm install

The file node_modules/@open-policy-agent/opa-wasm/src/opa.js will need to be
patched with the following implementation https://gist.github.com/aron/41eac08e8f1469a1c8139766524d3bad
which will expose the global TextEncoder and TextDecoder functions.

A browser build can then be created using a tool of choice e.g. rollup, webpack
or esbuild. And ensuring the `global` object is aliased to `window`.

An example of how to do this with esbuild:

    % brew install esbuild
    % esbuild index.js --define:global=window --bundle >! bundle.js
